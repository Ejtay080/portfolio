This took a lot because I asked my grandparents about Sun City (because they live there), and I really wanted to encapsulate their town the best I could.</p></td>

My favorite character was Maurice Moss, played by the hilarious Richard Ayoade. In one of the episodes, they mention a hilarious parady of Facebook, FriendFace! I was inspired to make it the exact same as I would have thought it to be.</p></td>
