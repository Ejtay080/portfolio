           <p class="cert1 cert1txt">I passed a CTE Skills Assessment test in my AP Computer Science A class. This allowed me to recieve a <strong>CTE Skills Certificate</strong>, which is highly valued in a computer science education.</p>

       <div class="career">
           <p>As a career, I aspire to be an indie game developer and create games with a small group. If my plan doesn't come to fruition, I will try to be a manager of programmers in a game development company. I have great social and leadership skills that will help me be the best manager I can be. I have experience with leadership opportunities, specifically, as a leader for a retreat for my youth group. Even though those opportunities aren't directly headed towards the career I'm aimed towards, it still helped me understand professional and social activities that helped me learn what it is truly like to be a leader. I am also now officially certified in HTML5, a website programming language, which gives me a leg up in the programming industry. Because of what I learned in the certification process, I now know what it is truly like to program a solo project, a team project, and work with others to create the best possible product. I am also working with my friend Evan to develop a game titled "<u>The Multiverse</u>" as a fan game. This will give me some insight in the process of developing, creating, and designing a game.</p>
