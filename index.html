           <p class="explaintxt">This project is made for recruiters of the Computer Science industry. I have always loved computers, since I was a kid. I've loved learning about them and understanding how they work. Ever since then, I knew that I wanted to be a computer programmer. I am currently enrolled in a Coding Program at West-MEC for my first year finished, and my second upcoming year. I also have taken numerous Computer Science classes before.</p>
