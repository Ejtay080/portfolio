           <p class="aboutmetxt">Hello! My name is Ethan Tayloe, and I want to be a game developer out of high school. In order to get a headstart in the programming department, I decided to take Website Design as a Class in my trade school West-MEC. I am 16 years old, soon to be 17, and a Junior in Hope High Online School. I've been both to online and brick and mortar high school. I love to travel with my family. We've been to many places such as Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, New York, Texas, Colorado, Florida, California, Utah, Wyoming, South Dakota, Tennessee, Missouri, and Oklahoma. I love coding, because it gives me this sense of creativity I don't usually have with most things. I can make things how I see them. Website Design has been great training for that kind of stuff. Also, I have been learning many different types of code, which gives me a lot of experience in this field. I love to play video games, make music, and hang with my friends. I hope that you continue to look throughout this project of mine, and learn more about me, what I've done, and what I can continue, and look forward, to do.</p>
