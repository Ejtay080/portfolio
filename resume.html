           <p class="resumemetxt">Music and QA testing different games and maps are things that I'm really passioniate about. I've been drumming since I was 11. I've made my own music and played with my worship group onstage for years. I have many friends who make games and need help finding bugs, or discrepencies within their code. I test their maps by looking for these issues, and solving them. An example of this is when my friend Stephen needed help designing his map for a contest. It ended up winning the contest out of more than 80 entries. I also love helping others and volunteering in my community. As a FBLA Officer and VP of Fundraising, I have organized, with my fellow peers and Officers, ways to create revenue and help others in need. We organized events like the "<u>Shoe Drive</u>" to help the unfortunate communities in Haiti. I also have had many volunteering opportunities in AFJROTC, like preparing packages of necessary items for soldiers overseas. My studies at school are a top priority. I won an Academic Excellence Award for having the highest grade in the class. Last summer, a friend and I started a computer assistanting business where I used my computer knowledge to help neighbors and friends to solve their technical difficulties for a small fee. In the future, I would love to have the opportunity to work at Valve Corporation. Since I love video games and want to design them, this would be a huge liftoff for me.</p>
